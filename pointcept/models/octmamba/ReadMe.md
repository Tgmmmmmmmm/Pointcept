- **Tags**: `Computer Vision`, `Point Cloud`, `State Space Models`, `3D Segmentation`, `3D Classification`

## Key Contributions

1. **Novel Architecture**:

   - First SSM-based backbone for point clouds with octree-based ordering strategy.
   - Solves the conflict between SSM's causality requirement and point clouds' irregularity.

2. **Technical Innovation**:

   - **Octree Z-Ordering**: Globally sorts points while preserving spatial proximity.
   - **Linear Complexity**: More efficient than transformer-based methods (O(n) vs O(nÂ²)).

3. **Performance**:
   - **ModelNet40**: 93.4% classification accuracy
   - **ScanNet**: 75.7 mIoU (semantic segmentation)
